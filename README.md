🚀 **Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning**
📌 Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning models. The analysis is based on the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset and compares Logistic Regression, k-NN, and SVC to determine the best model for deployment.

📂 Dataset
📌 Source: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)
📌 Target Variable: Attrition (Yes = 1, No = 0)

📌 Key Features Selected:
OverTime → Frequent overtime can lead to burnout.
MonthlyIncome → Low salary can increase attrition risk.
YearsAtCompany → New employees are more likely to leave.
JobSatisfaction → Low satisfaction drives resignations.
WorkLifeBalance → Poor balance increases quitting risk.

🏆 Model Comparison
Compared three models - Logistic Regression, k-NN and SVC
Best Model: ✅ Logistic Regression – Offers the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability for HR teams.
